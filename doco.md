This migration plan outlines the process for migrating from GitHub AE (GHAE) to GitHub Enterprise Server (GHES) with the objective of transferring repositories, user accounts, teams, and settings. The migration aims to enhance control, security, and customization of our GitHub environment while minimizing disruption to business continuity.

The plan is divided into four phases: Pre-migration Preparation, Data and Configuration Migration, User and Team Transition, and Post-migration Review and Cleanup. Each phase has specific tasks, timelines, and responsibilities for the migration team to ensure a successful migration.

During the Pre-migration Preparation phase, we will define migration objectives, assess the existing GHAE environment, and perform a dry run test to validate the migration plan. We will also group repositories into logical tranches based on risk and impact to business continuity.

The Data and Configuration Migration phase focuses on migrating repositories, configurations, and integrations, followed by thorough testing and validation.

In the User and Team Transition phase, we will communicate with users, provide training, and migrate user accounts and teams in a systematic manner.

The final phase, Post-migration Review and Cleanup, involves reviewing the migration process, conducting additional testing, and decommissioning GHAE.

By following this plan, we aim to achieve a successful migration from GHAE to GHES, maintaining data integrity, user access, and business continuity. Effective communication and collaboration among team members and stakeholders will be key to a smooth transition.
